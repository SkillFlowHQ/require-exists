# require-exists [![NPM](https://img.shields.io/npm/v/require-exists.svg)](https://npmjs.com/package/require-exists)

Verifies that each require() (whether relative-path or package) exists.

## install and usage

```sh
$ npm install -g require-exists
$ require-exists # in the directory where package.json is
```

## roadmap

Currently makes a lot of assumptions about how the files are arranged.
Will be fixed eventually.
